                    <p>
                        The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for the right business as
                        they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to
                        increase your visibility and find the right customers for your business.

                    <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with
                        an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation
                        Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your
                        business.

                    <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Social media continues to have a sizable influence on buying habits. Social media marketing
                        helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, using analytics to find the right
                        markets and increase your lead generation.

                <img src="./assets/images/lead-generation.png" />
                <p>
                    Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers
                    directly to your website.

                <p>
                    Users find your business through paid and organic searches, increasing the search ranking and
                    visibility for your business.

                    As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no
                    longer need to advertise your page.
